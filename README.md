# Repo Description

This project-based repo takes you on a hands-on journey into the world of agentic and AI-powered chatbots. 
You’ll start with the basics of AI and natural language processing, then gradually dive into modern frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, and advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

Instead of just learning theory, you’ll be building real, production-ready AI systems from the ground up. 
By the end, you’ll have created fully functional chatbots and autonomous AI agents that can reason, retrieve information, take actions, and adapt on their own.

# Throughout the course, you’ll gain practical, in-demand skills such as:

  * Understanding how intelligent assistants are designed and structured.

  * Connecting large language models (LLMs) with knowledge bases using RAG.

  * Developing AI agents that can use tools and make decisions.

  * Working with LangChain and LangGraph to build dynamic AI pipelines.

  * Deploying, testing, and scaling your chatbots for real-world applications.

# And tust me , you would love the tone and the flow !
