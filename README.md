# Repo Description

This is a project-oriented learning repo that takes you on a hands-on journey into the world of agentic and AI-powered chatbots.  
You’ll start with the basics of AI and natural language processing, then gradually dive into modern frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, and advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

Instead of just learning theory, you’ll be building real, production-ready AI systems from the ground up.  
By the end, you’ll have created fully functional chatbots and autonomous AI agents that can reason, retrieve information, take actions, and adapt on their own.

## Throughout the journey, you’ll gain practical, in-demand skills such as:

- Understanding how intelligent assistants are designed and structured.
- Connecting large language models (LLMs) with knowledge bases using RAG.
- Developing AI agents that can use tools and make decisions.
- Working with LangChain and LangGraph to build dynamic AI pipelines.
- Deploying, testing, and scaling your chatbots for real-world applications.

# Trust me, you’ll love the tone and the flow!

## What will we be cooking?

- Build a chatbot and evolve it into an extremely complex, production-grade application.
- Build agents, relevant tools, memory/state, and implement an orchestration layer.
- Build highly sophisticated workflows aimed at solving real-world problems.
- Bonus: A bunch of project ideas with hints to help you level up your skills.
